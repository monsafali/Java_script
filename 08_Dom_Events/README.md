Qs3. Create an input element on the page with a placeholder ”enter your name” and an
H2 heading on the page inside HTML.
The purpose of this input element is to enter a user’s name so it should only input
letters from a-z, A-Z and space (all other characters should not be detected).
Whenever the user inputs their name, their input should be dynamically visible inside
the heading.

visible in the heading]
